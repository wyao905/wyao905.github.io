### Project
Virtual Classroom is an application built using JavaScript React for the front-end and Ruby on Rails for the back-end API. The goal of the application is to provide an online virtual classroom environment for both students and instructors.

The application allows instructors to broadcast lecture texts line by line in real time to students. The real time client to client interaction is achieved using Socket.IO. Students and instructors can also leave messages to each other via a comment section. All lectures are saved and available to view for students and instructors after they're created.

Some future goals of the project involves implementing some sort of video broadcast capability during the live classes as well as incorporating an instant messaging feature. There are also some issues that need to be fixed, including how the application will respond when someone disconnects during a class session and limiting accessibility of said sessions to the intended users.

### Instructions
Start off by signing up as a new user. It is recommended to create two user accounts, one as a student and the other as an instructor, to fully explore all the features. Once you sign up, you can login using your new credentials. If you created both a student and instructor account, it is best to login as an instructor first and create a subject, then enroll your student into that subject.

Alternatively, you can explore the app using previously created accounts from seeded data (warning, some book spoilers involved):
